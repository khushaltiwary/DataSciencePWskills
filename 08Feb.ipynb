    "Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It is one of the fundamental concepts of OOPs that allows developers to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",

    "Abstraction provides a way to manage complexity in software development, making it easier to design, implement, and maintain large and complex systems. By abstracting away the details of how an object works, developers can create more modular and reusable code, reducing the amount of duplicated code and making the system easier to maintain."
