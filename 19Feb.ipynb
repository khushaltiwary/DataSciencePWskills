    "\n",
    "    Easy to Learn and Use: Flask has a simple API and a small learning curve, making it easy for developers to get started with building web applications in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modular Design: Flask has a modular design, allowing you to choose the components you need and leave out the ones you don't. This makes it easy to build small, single-purpose applications as well as large, complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, allowing you to test your application without having to set up a separate server.\n",
