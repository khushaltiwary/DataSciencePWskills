The request is sent in the URL of the request, and any parameters are encoded as part of the URL. For example, a GET request to retrieve information about a book might look like this:\n",

    "The POST method is used to submit data to a server. When a client makes a POST request, it sends data to the server as part of the request body, rather than in the URL. The data can be encoded in a variety of formats, such as JSON or form data. For example, a POST request to create a new book might look like this:\n",
