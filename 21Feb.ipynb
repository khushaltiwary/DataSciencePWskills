    "Beautiful Soup is used for web scraping as it makes the process of extracting data from web pages easier by providing methods to extract information from an HTML or XML tree structure. It handles common web scraping issues like nested tags, encoding, and format inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also allows web scraping without requiring knowledge of regular expressions and low-level HTML parsing. It provides a higher-level interface that abstracts away the low-level details of parsing the HTML/XML tree. It also supports parsing documents from different sources like files, URLs, and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Beautiful Soup is a widely used library for web scraping and data extraction because of its simplicity, flexibility, and robustness."

    "Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python that is often used for building web applications. In the context of web scraping, Flask can be used to create a web server that can be accessed by users to perform scraping tasks. Flask provides a simple and efficient way to create web endpoints that can receive requests and return responses, which can be useful for web scraping applications that need to be accessed by multiple users or automated scripts.\n",

    "In a web scraping project, Flask can be used to create a web interface where users can input URLs or search queries, and receive scraped data as a response. Flask can also be used to handle complex scraping tasks that require multiple steps or input parameters, by breaking down the task into smaller functions or endpoints. Additionally, Flask provides a simple way to deploy web scraping applications on a server, making it easy to share scraping results with others.\n"
