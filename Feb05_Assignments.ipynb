    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface through which other objects can interact with it. This helps to ensure that the object's state is not accidentally modified, and it provides a way to enforce data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the practice of representing complex real-world objects using simplified models that capture the essential features of the object while hiding unnecessary details. This helps to reduce the complexity of a system, making it easier to understand and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows new classes to be created based on existing classes. The new class inherits the properties and behavior of the existing class and can then add its own unique features or modify the behavior of the inherited features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class. This allows code to be written that can work with objects of multiple types, making it more flexible and adaptable."
